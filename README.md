# Matrix Indicator

## Overview


The Matrix Indicator is a comprehensive TradingView Pine Script v5 tool designed to help traders identify:
- Trend direction
- Buy/sell signals
- Trendline breakouts
- Order blocks (bullish & bearish)
- Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
- Automatic Fibonacci extension levels

It is suitable for both discretionary and algorithmic trading strategies.




### Main Features

- **Buy/Sell Signals**: ATR-based trailing stop and optional Heikin Ashi candles generate buy and sell signals, visually marked on the chart and available for TradingView alerts.
- **Trendline Detection and Breakouts**: Dynamic trendlines based on swing highs/lows, with slope options (ATR, standard deviation, linear regression). Breakout points are highlighted when price crosses trendlines.
- **Order Blocks (Bullish & Bearish)**: Highlights bullish (green) and bearish (red) order blocks, helping to identify potential support and resistance zones.
- **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**: Detects and highlights all fair value gaps (gaps between candles). Gaps are visually removed/filled when price returns to the gap area.
- **Auto Fibonacci Extension**: Automatically draws Fibonacci extension levels based on recent pivots, with customizable levels and visual options.


### Technical Concepts Used

- **ATR (Average True Range)**: Trailing stop and trendline slope calculation
- **Heikin Ashi Candles**: Optional smoothing for buy/sell signals
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Crossover logic for buy/sell signals
- **Swing Highs/Lows**: Pivot detection for trendlines and FIB
- **Standard Deviation & Linear Regression**: Alternative trendline slope methods
- **Order Block Detection**: Last up/down candle before reversal
